# CodeBrain

CodeBrain is a hobby of mine. It is intended to become a game in which the player used the console to create a botnet, using tools provided, and tools that can be bought using the in-game currency. The botnet is used to mine said currency. The bigger the player's botnet, the larger the income.

Any code edits, optimisations or suggestions are greatly appreciated and welcomed.
